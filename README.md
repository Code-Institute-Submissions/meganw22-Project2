# Noughts and Crosses
This website has been created for Project Portfolio 2.
Noughts and Crosses is a classic two player game played on a 3x3 grid and has the option for 1 or 2 players. 
The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a row, column or diagonal of 3 matching symbols but if the entire grid is filled and no matches are present, the game is decalred a draw. It is typically a game of strategy and logic.

## User Stories
* As a player, I want to enjoy a user-friendly and visually appealing website for a good gaming experience
* As a player, I want the option of playing against a computer or second individual.
* As a player, I want to have prompts and feedback about the game status
* As a player, I want to be able to see the current scores 
* As a player, I want to control the game using clearly labelled buttons
* As a player, I want the game to prevent further plays if the game has been completed

## Wireframes
Before commencing with creating the game, I designed some wireframes to show the general layout of the webpage.
### New Game Overlay

## Colour Scheme
I chose to keep my colour scheme simple and only chose a select few colours to design the webpage. The colours can clearly distinguish the different elements and provides a consistant look and feel which improves the overall design.

## Typography
Using Google fonts, I selected the font **Fredoka** to use throughout the game. I found it to be a simple yet fun font and ensured the font was shown in Semibold 600.

# Features

## Game functions
### Overlays
I have designed the game with overlays to draw the users attention which places the message front and centre so it is difficult to miss. Overlays also provide clarity by reducing the clutter from the webpage when the item is not currently in use.

* Initial Screen
*   When the user navigates to the webpage, an overlay with instructions for game play is covering the game area.

After clicking the 'Let's Go' button, the overlay is removed and the webpage ready for player selection.

* New Game
*   When a game is finished, the overlay will cover the content of the game area only and provide a button to start the next game.

### Score Area
 
### Game Status

### Favicon

## Future Development
### Customisable symbols
Users can decide which symbol they would like to play against the computer as currently the computer will always play 'O'.

### Level of difficulty 
When playing against the Computer, there is a very likely chance of winning. I plan to improve the computers programming capability to block more than 2 matches in a row from the player. This will increase the challenge of winning against the computer. 

### Computer can make the first move
Currently, the computer always has the 2nd move of the game. Typically, the first move dictactes the stategy of the game and can hugely increase the first players advantage and chance of winning. My plan is allow the computer to place a move first to adjust the game play for more strategic gaming.
