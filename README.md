# Noughts and Crosses
This website has been created for Project Portfolio 2.
Noughts and Crosses is a classic two player game played on a 3x3 grid and has the option for 1 or 2 players. 
The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a row, column or diagonal of 3 matching symbols but if the entire grid is filled and no matches are present, the game is decalred a draw. It is typically a game of strategy and logic.
