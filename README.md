# Noughts and Crosses
This website has been created for Project Portfolio 2.
Noughts and Crosses is a classic two player game played on a 3x3 grid and has the option for 1 or 2 players. 
The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a row, column or diagonal of 3 matching symbols but if the entire grid is filled and no matches are present, the game is decalred a draw. It is typically a game of strategy and logic.

## User Stories
* As a player, I want to enjoy a user-friendly and visually appealing website for a good gaming experience
* As a player, I want the option of playing against a computer or second individual.
* As a player, I want to have prompts and feedback about the game status
* As a player, I want to be able to see the current scores 
* As a player, I want to control the game using clearly labelled buttons

## Wireframes
Before commencing with creating the game, I designed some wireframes to show the general layout of the webpage.

## Colour Scheme
I chose to keep my colour scheme simple and only chose a select few colours to design the webpage. The colours can clearly distinguish the different elements and provides a consistant look and feel which improves the overall design.
